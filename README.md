<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am 23 years old and learning software engineering to better my family's life. I live in Maryville Tennessee with my 4 year old son, 5 month old daughter and their mother. I have had a love for technology since I was little and built the pc I am currently using when I was 13. I enjoy being outdoors as much as I enjoy being inside writing code. I currently work as a carpenter with over 10 years of experience. Even though I love the work I do I feel like it's time for a major change and software engineering feels perfect for that change. </p>
